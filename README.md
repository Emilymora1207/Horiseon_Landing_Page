# <Week 1 Challenge>

## Description

This is The first Feature Request Challenge that I have completed. My goal was to0 improve the html code, adding semantic tags, to make it more readable. I realized through this Challenge that you need to keep remember to check how your stylesheet is labeled when changing any tags, because this can drastically change the look of your site.
